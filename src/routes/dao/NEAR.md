# Radicle Grants Program

If you're reading this, you're as interested as we are in promoting Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and the
ever growing Web3 ecosystem.

To this end, Radicle is introducing its own grants program, the Radicle Grants Program.

The aim is to directly support open source initiatives that help grow the Radicle product, the Radicle community, and
the greater FOSS and Web3 community at large.

This page will cover the basics of the Radicle Grants Program's ethos, application processes, and structure.

### Guidelines

Come one, come all!

We are open to any applications, whether you are applying to tackle an RFP we've provided or you're applying with some
ideas of your own.

In general, though, the focus is on technical projects, such as additions to core Radicle software or components of
Web3 infrastructure that interact with Radicle.

Below are high level things we look for:

- Your project has **sustainability** front and center. A project that has a plan to be **self-sustaining** and **maintained**
  for the long run will shine above others. We would love nothing more than to have a Radicle grant act as seed funding
  for projects that create value well beyond the grant's initial window.
- Your project is **open source** through and through. It ideally contributes to some core Radicle product features and
  reflects a deep empathy for others working on FOSS. This includes an understanding of the importance of documentation,
  maintainibility, extensibility, testing, and clean coding principals.
- You have **strong and relevant** experience. We're looking for pros who have a proven track record in whatever
  language, frameworks, and tooling are needed to get a project past the finish line.

Lastly, all work **must** adhere to the following criteria:

- All code produced during your grant must be **open-sourced** with proper licensing (Apache 2.0, GPLv3, MIT or
  Unlicense).
- All code must not rely on closed-sourced software or infrastructure to be fully functioning.
- We will not fund projects that support any illicit activity (gambling, money laundering, etc.).

We take licensing and proper recognition very seriously. We want to celebrate not just your work, but the work
of the giants whose shoulders we are building on. Any attempt to pass work that is not yours off as your own will be
grounds for **immediate termination** of work without pay. Please feel free to start a discussion if you are unsure on
any work.

### Project Ideas

We see project ideas coming from 2 main sources:

- [Requests For Proposals](rfps) (RFPs) will be clearly outlined projects that we would like to see implemented.
  We accept applications to tackle RFPs from multiple individuals and teams. This means you may be in competition for a
  grant. Where it makes sense, we may also award one grant across multiple teams.
- Open Applications. These will follow the same format as our internal RFPs. If you have an idea for an RFP that you
  don't see, by all means send in an application. More on this in the [process](#process) section.

No matter the source of the project idea, the entire application process will be transparent and public on Radicle.

Currently the RFPs come centrally from the core development team. The end goal is to progressively decentralize this
process such that the line between RFP and open applications is blurred and goes away over time. Open application will
be treated as a first class citizen!

### Support

The scope of Radicle Grants includes the following:

- Feedback before/during the application process
- Funding
- Feedback on delivered milestones

Outside of these 3 Fs, the grant will not provide a hands-on assistance or mentorship experience.

We are expecting individuals and teams who are planning to own the work from start to finish.
