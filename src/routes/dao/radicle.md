# Radicle Grants Program

If you're reading this, you're as interested as we are in promoting Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and the
ever growing Web3 ecosystem.

To this end, Radicle is introducing its own grants program, the Radicle Grants Program.

The aim is to directly support open source initiatives that help grow the Radicle product, the Radicle community, and
the greater FOSS and Web3 community at large.

This page will cover the basics of the Radicle Grants Program's ethos, application processes, and structure.

## Levels

The Radicle Grants Program offers different grant levels to help you best depending on your current stage.

If you have a question about which level to apply to, please reach out on the Grant's #ðŸ’¬general category on [Discord](https://discord.gg/aNZdn5hP).

### ðŸŒ± Seed Grants (Level 1)

Seed grants are meant for smaller projects, both in terms of complexity and cost.

- **Target:** Individuals & small teams
- **Amount:** less than $50,000

### ðŸŒ² Tree Grants (Level 2)

Seed grants are meant for larger projects in terms of scope, complexity, and time to completion.

- **Target:** teams, companies, or foundations with a proven record
- **Amount:** more than $50,000 (up to $500,000)

## Process

As noted, we expect applications to be based on existing RFPs or an open application.

The entire process includes these 3 steps:

#### 1. [Application & Review](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/main/grants/applications)

#### 2. [Milestone Delivery](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/hyperlinkFixes/grants/milestone_deliveries) & [Milestone Evaluation](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/hyperlinkFixes/grants/milestone_evaluations)

#### 3. [Payment](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/main/grants#payment)

### Guidelines

Come one, come all!

We are open to any applications, whether you are applying to tackle an RFP we've provided or you're applying with some
ideas of your own.

In general, though, the focus is on technical projects, such as additions to core Radicle software or components of
Web3 infrastructure that interact with Radicle.

Below are high level things we look for:

- Your project has **sustainability** front and center. A project that has a plan to be **self-sustaining** and **maintained**
  for the long run will shine above others. We would love nothing more than to have a Radicle grant act as seed funding
  for projects that create value well beyond the grant's initial window.
- Your project is **open source** through and through. It ideally contributes to some core Radicle product features and
  reflects a deep empathy for others working on FOSS. This includes an understanding of the importance of documentation,
  maintainibility, extensibility, testing, and clean coding principals.
- You have **strong and relevant** experience. We're looking for pros who have a proven track record in whatever
  language, frameworks, and tooling are needed to get a project past the finish line.

Lastly, all work **must** adhere to the following criteria:

- All code produced during your grant must be **open-sourced** with proper licensing (Apache 2.0, GPLv3, MIT or
  Unlicense).
- All code must not rely on closed-sourced software or infrastructure to be fully functioning.
- We will not fund projects that support any illicit activity (gambling, money laundering, etc.).

We take licensing and proper recognition very seriously. We want to celebrate not just your work, but the work
of the giants whose shoulders we are building on. Any attempt to pass work that is not yours off as your own will be
grounds for **immediate termination** of work without pay. Please feel free to start a discussion if you are unsure on
any work.
